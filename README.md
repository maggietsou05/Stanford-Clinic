# Stanford-Clinic
This is a 8-week remote project with Stanford Medicine's nephrology clinic. During this project, I explored real clinic workflows, identified inefficiencies, and redesigned processes to improve patient care. Then, a digital dashboard was made with Claude AI to support faster, better decision-making for the medical professionals at this clinic.

All decision support are based on global & U.S. healthcare guidelines (KDIGO, KDOQI, CMS)

### The dashboard prototype can be found [here](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/19c3f7e9-815e-45b2-9e95-6f069699c3e0)

Decision support and patient symptom tracking is available for:
1. Registered Nurse (RN)
2. Advanced Practice Provider (APP)
3. Nephrologist (MD)
4. Patient Care Coordinator (PCC)<br><br>

RNs are able to quickly write down any patient issues, and check from the list of observed symptoms that present as "escalation triggers" by industry standards <br>

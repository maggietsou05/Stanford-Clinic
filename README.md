# Stanford-Clinic
This is a 8-week remote project with Stanford Medicine's Nephrology Clinic. During this project, I explored real clinic workflows, identified inefficiencies, and redesigned processes to improve patient care. Then, a digital dashboard was made with Claude AI to support faster, better decision-making for the medical professionals at this clinic.

All decision support are based on global & U.S. healthcare guidelines (KDIGO, KDOQI, CMS)

This project was done in collaboration with the nurse practitioner of Stanford Nephrology Clinic 

### The dashboard prototype can be found [here](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/19c3f7e9-815e-45b2-9e95-6f069699c3e0)

## Functions

Decision support and patient symptom tracking is available for:
1. Registered Nurse (RN)
2. Advanced Practice Provider (APP)
3. Nephrologist (MD)
4. Patient Care Coordinator (PCC)<br><br><br>

RNs are able to quickly write down any patient issues, and check from the list of observed symptoms that present as "escalation triggers" by industry standards. <br><br><br>

The dashboard will automatically assign a patient ID and save documented symptoms. Immediate Action Steps and Escalation Protocols are then given. Here is an example of a patient presenting with shortness of breath, crackles on auscultation, and an elevated BP: <br><br>

1. IMMEDIATE: Escalate to APP within 5 minutes <br>
2. Document findings in EHR under 'pre-dialysis assessment' <br>
3. If APP unavailable, notify covering nephrologist via pager/text <br><br>

If other symptoms are newly presented, other roles such as APP are able to add them using the existing patient ID. <br>
The diagnostician, or MD, are able to see exactly what symptoms occured at what time. <br>
The PCC will have the full patient history, as well as patient education points, to assist in communication with the patient or their families. <br><br>

Lastly, I developed a change management plan to help clinics adopt the dashboard smoothly. It can be found [here](Training_Strategy)
